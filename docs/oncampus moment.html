    <h2>Oncampus Moment</h2>
 <p>Even though I was busy preparing for my exams, the school thoughtfully prepared a D-Day (Dandelion Day) for us. It was a special day for students to relax and enjoy themselves. The event was held on the green grass lawn, giving a relaxing atmosphere. It is a day to leave the busy schedule of studies behind for a while and enjoy the campus.

The D-Day event offers various entertainment programs and activities. We can taste delicious food from different food trucks and indulge in a variety of flavors and cuisines. In addition, there were carnival games and park facilities that allowed us to participate in various fun competitions and experience exciting rides. The basketball game was a particular favorite of mine, inspiring a sense of joy and accomplishment within me every time I successfully hit a basket.

In addition, the student band showcase was a highly anticipated highlight of D-Day. They played a variety of music with enthusiasm, bringing melodies and energy to the entire campus. Whenever the band played, I was captivated by the music and immersed in the sea of music with my classmates.
</p>
<p>D-Day provided a valuable opportunity for me to take a break from my busy study schedule and enjoy the fun of campus life. Such activities not only show the school's care and support for students, but also strengthen the bond and friendship among students. On D-Day, I was able to spend a pleasant time with my classmates and feel the joy and endless possibilities in campus life.
