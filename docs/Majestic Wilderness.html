    <h2>Majestic Wilderness</h2>
	<p>Last summer, me and four friends flight to Cancun for clean and
beautiful sea and delicious sea food. In the above figure,
the different color of the sea is because of different
density. I took this photo on the way to diving in
Isla Mujeres, a small Island in Mexico. Diving to see
the sculptures under the sea is the coolest experience
in my life. Salty water and enormous sculpture witnessing
the vicissitudes of the sea.
In Mayan, “Cancun” means “a tile pot hanging at the
end of a rainbow” and is considered a symbol of joy
and happiness, hence the city’s name. We enjoyed
being surrounded by the turquoise Caribbean Sea,
with superb raw seafood to satisfy our appetite; walking
down the hotel’s beach to see the breathtakingly
beautiful Tiffany blue sea; and driving a few hours to
the wild adventure area.</p>

	This photo was taken at Ontario Beach Park after I returned to Rochester from Cancun last summer. The seagulls in this image are strolling freely at the intersection of the seawater and the sand, and they appear to be relishing a moment of leisure and relaxation. The sea breeze ruffles their feathers and the sun shines on their white feathers, creating a serene and beautiful image. This image made me feel serene and relieved, as if I too was integrated into the embrace of nature, feeling the bounty of the ocean and the beauty of nature.

	This photo was taken during my trip to Glenwood Springs Resort in Colorado last Christmas. Even though the temperature outside dropped to -10 degrees, my friends and I were enjoying the warmth of the hot springs. We were talking about life and relaxing, when suddenly we looked up and saw the snow-capped mountains in the distance and the train just whizzing by, creating a picture of movement and tranquility. The contrast between the cold weather and the warmth of the hot springs, the snowy mountains and the train created a unique atmosphere. This image made me feel awe and serenity, and at the same time made me realize the wonderful encounter between the beautiful moments in life and the natural landscape. This experience made me deeply appreciate the magnificence of nature and the harmonious coexistence of man and nature.
