    <h2>Botanical moment</h2>
 
  <p>We were excited to plan a cheerful picnic in the verdant meadow in front of the Rush Rhee Library. The quiet setting offered the ideal background for our reunion. With the warm sun shining down and the breeze rustling the leaves, we could not have found a more idyllic place. My dear friend Oliver graciously volunteered to take a beautiful photo of me sitting on the soft grass and soaking in the peaceful atmosphere. I believe this particular snapshot encapsulates the essence of our memorable day and will be a wonderful addition to my program.</p>

<p>In addition, I had an enchanting encounter with the cherry blossoms in bloom on campus after a grueling exam. As I wandered down the picture-postcard lane, the petite petals danced in the air, painting the surroundings with pink and white hues. In a moment of utter pure bliss, I was unable to resist extending my arms as if I were embracing the sky itself and flashing a huge smile.
</p>
<p>
These precious moments not only gave me a respite from the demands of academics but also reminded me of the profound healing power of nature and the joy it brings to our lives.</p>
