    <h2>Spiritual Reflection-Church</h2>
     
  <p>Last winter, I had the privilege of attending a winter retreat at LeTourneau Christian Center. This church is located on the edge of a lake, allowing us to enjoy the stunning lake view and the flurries of snow. Each morning we began with a beautiful worship service after a delicious breakfast, where we sang songs of praise in unison and our hearts were washed with music and song. Then, we will study chapters of the Bible together, delving into its mysteries and revelations.

	During the afternoon, we will break into small groups according to different topics and have discussions about the Bible and share our personal reflections and insights. These interactions allow us to gain a deeper understanding of God's Word and to draw from each other's experiences and insights. And at the end, we would gather together again to engage in a variety of fun games and activities together as laughter and joy filled the venue.

<p> In this special setting, despite the cold weather outside, I felt the warmth and family-like companionship given by my brothers and sisters. The care and common faith of everyone made me feel incredibly happy and satisfied. The spiritual relaxation and happiness allowed me to completely leave behind the pressure of exams and studies and fully immerse myself in intimate communion with God.</p>

<p>This time of winter retreat allowed me to gain a deeper spiritual experience and to build a closer connection with like-minded friends. I will always cherish this wonderful memory and thank God for the precious time I spent there.</p>
